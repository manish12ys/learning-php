# PHP Tutorial

## Introduction to PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source server-side scripting language designed primarily for web development. This repository contains tutorial materials and examples to help you learn PHP from the ground up.

## What is PHP?

- **Server-Side Language**: PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML that is sent to the client's browser.
- **Embedded in HTML**: PHP can be embedded directly within HTML, making it easy to create dynamic web content.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on various platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) and supports most web servers.
- **Database Compatible**: Integrates seamlessly with most database systems, especially MySQL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web server (like Apache or Nginx)
- PHP installed (version 7.4+ recommended)
- A text editor or IDE (VS Code, PHPStorm, etc.)
- Basic understanding of HTML

### Installation

#### Windows

1. Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
2. Start the Apache server from the control panel
3. Place your PHP files in the `htdocs` folder

#### macOS

1. macOS comes with PHP pre-installed
2. Alternatively, install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php
```

## Basic Syntax

PHP scripts start with `<?php` and end with `?>`:

```php
<?php
  echo "Hello, World!";
?>
```

## Key Features

- **Variables**: Easy to declare and use
- **Arrays**: Both indexed and associative
- **Control Structures**: If/else, switch, loops
- **Functions**: Built-in and user-defined
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch blocks
- **File Handling**: Read, write, and manipulate files
- **Form Handling**: Process user input securely
- **Database Operations**: Connect to and query databases
- **Session Management**: Track user data across pages

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `/basics` - Fundamental PHP concepts
- `/forms` - Form handling examples
- `/database` - Database connection and operations
- `/oop` - Object-oriented programming examples
- `/projects` - Complete mini-projects

## Learning Path

1. Start with basic syntax and variables
2. Move on to control structures and functions
3. Learn about forms and user input
4. Explore database connectivity
5. Dive into object-oriented programming
6. Build complete applications

## Best Practices

- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use prepared statements for database queries
- Follow a consistent coding style
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep business logic separate from presentation
